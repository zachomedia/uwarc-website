    <h2 class="subheader">Purpose</h2>
    <p>One of the primary goals of the UW Amateur Radio Club is to include
    and support <strong>all</strong> members of the University of Waterloo
    community who are interested in amateur radio. As such, we are
    committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
    all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity,
    socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).</p>
    <p>We invite all those who participate in our events and who
    communicate with our community at large to help us create a safe and
    positive experience for everyone involved.</p>
    <p>We've outlined a code of conduct to highlight our expectations for
    all individuals who participate in our community, as well as the steps
    to handle unacceptable behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Unacceptable behaviors include:</strong> intimidating,
    harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or
    actions by any participant in our community online, at all related
    events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of
    community business. Community event venues may be shared; please be
    respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>

    or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race,
    religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images

    Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
    <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors
    and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>
    <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
    immediately.</p>
    <p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the
    community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to
    and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the
    community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid
    event).</p>

    Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
    <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any
    other concerns, please notify an organizer or titled member as soon as
    possible.</p>
    <p>Additionally, community organizers are available to help community
    members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those
    experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of
    in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by
    the person experiencing distress.</p>

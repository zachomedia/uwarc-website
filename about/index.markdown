# About

The University of Waterloo Amateur Radio Club is a club at the
[University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) for exploring

those who are licensed and those who are not.

The club callsign is VE3UOW.

# Meeting

The club meets on most Fridays at 6:00PM in E2 4402. Anyone is welcome
to attend a club meeting. If you don't know where to go,
please [contact us]({{site.url}}/contact/) and we'll show you the way.

We perform many different activities at our meetings, including:
